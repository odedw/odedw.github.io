                Learning new stuff and finding the right tool for the job. I started developing in C++, then Java and .Net, took a detour with Objective C for an iPad app and inevitably ended up with Javascript. Today I use a bit of each in my day job and mainly Javascript in my spare time. I have experience with cloud architecture and use Azure to host all of my creations. I love that we live in a time where we can deploy a site, scale to multiple instances, easliy spin up a VM or do many other things that used to take days, in a matter of minutes and at very low cost. All of these are no longer <a href="http://www.hanselman.com/blog/WeAreAbstractingOnTheShouldersOfGiants.aspx" target="_blank">obstacles</a> on our creative path.
