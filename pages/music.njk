    Music is an integral part of my life. I started playing piano when I was little, and have played many different instruments in many different bands since then. 
    I find that very often the creativity and problem solving involved in music making for me is very similar in essence to software development, which is why I enjoy the two.
    Here are a few recordings of music I created or had a part in making.
